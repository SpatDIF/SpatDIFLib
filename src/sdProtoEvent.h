/**
 * @brief  An abstract class of event inherited from sdProtoMeta. This class maintains additionaly time value.
 * @detail This class can only be used by sdEntity. All member variables are declared as const. Thus, all parameter must be set by initializer list. Modification of events are not possible in SpatDIF Library. Discard the instance, create new one, and move the unchanged data to new one, if modification of member data is required.
